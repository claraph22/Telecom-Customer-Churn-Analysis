## Introduction

This project aims to analyze customer churn within a telecommunications company. By exploring the data, we can identify the key factors that influence whether a customer will stay with or leave the company. The project utilizes various machine learning techniques to build predictive models that can accurately forecast customer churn.

**Tools & Libraries Used:**
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

This project is designed for data scientists and analysts who are interested in predictive modeling and customer behavior analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle:

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- **Size**: The dataset contains several entries with multiple features including customer demographics, account information, and service usage details.

## Project Structure

This project is organized as follows:

```plaintext
P1M2_Clara.ipynb - Jupyter notebook containing the analysis
README.md        - Project documentation
```

## Installation

To run the notebook, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. **Open the Jupyter notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook P1M2_Clara.ipynb
   ```

4. **Run the cells** to perform the analysis. You can modify parameters or explore different parts of the dataset as needed.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizing the distribution of key features and identifying trends.
- **Modeling**: Implementing and comparing various machine learning models including decision trees, random forests, and boosting algorithms.
- **Evaluation**: Using cross-validation and other metrics to assess model performance.
